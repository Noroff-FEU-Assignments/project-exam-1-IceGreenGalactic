    <p>Welcome to Kennel Shirkus, a small, love-filled breeding of black/white and silver-grey large poodles.

      breeds.

      Our poodles live with us as beloved family members and we are proud to say that they have wonderful personalities
      and are highly socialized.
    </p>
    <h3> Our goal</h3>
